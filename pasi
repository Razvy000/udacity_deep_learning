BIG WARNING:
	DO NOT DO THIS ON YOUR DAILY COMPUTER
	RECOMMEND A FRESH UBUNTU YOU CAN EASILY REINSTALL
	IF MIGHT INSTALL A BAD DRIVER VERSION AND REMOVING IT MIGHT BE A PAIN



install driver (auto) | view in settings | lscpi
	verify driver cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version


install cuda from local (deb) ...network (deb) did not work

	Further to @TimZaman I'd just like to point out that CUDA runtime error (30) might show if your program is unable to create or open the /dev/nvidia-uvm device file. This is usually fixed by installing package nvidia-modprobe:

sudo apt-get install nvidia-modprobe
Note also that since your GPU has compute capability 2.1 as per this page you will not be able to use CuDNN and will need to disable support for CuDNN in the Caffe makefile.

	NU!!!
	apt-get install cuda - This will install the latest toolkit (currently 7.5) and the latest driver 			(currently nvidia-352).
	IMPORTANT: Don't install this package if you installed your driver with a run file. The Deb package may not be able to fully uninstall your run file driver installation.
	DA!!!
	apt-get install cuda-toolkit-7-5 - Installs only the toolkit and not the driver.
	NU!!!
	apt-get install cuda-drivers - Installs only the driver and not the toolkit.
